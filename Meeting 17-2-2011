Present Aaron, Owen, Alex

Unit tests show good practices and give us something to write about
Nightly builds?
Owen has a server we could use if github dont help us out or as a test platform

Roles?
Owen Alex Aaron are all confident writing code but are willing to write
Imm mentioned before she would prefer to write 

Leadership?
Small group no need for a leader
Vote on any issues we have
Need to make sure when deadlines approach everyone is going to be ready

Q&A ?
How many users are you going to have ?
What news affects your decisions at the bank
What news sources do you currently use
What would the perfect news sources be
What systems are you going to deploy it on
Should we push news to the device or should the device poll for it


Look at the amount of tweets per minuite on a certain topic, then if we get a spike in tweets for a certain topic look at it in more detail
Twitter should carry less weight than a BBC news source

Owen recommends reading articles on joelonsoftware.com which looks at good programming practices

Programming Language
Everyone is happy with Java
Owen and Alex have experience in C++
C++ would allow us to use cURL

We could track whats trending, this would take care of some of the work for us
Could track whats growing quickest

Look at pulling tweets from known journalists as this solves the relability of the information problem
Twitter search API looks like it should meet our needs
Twitter has an "attitudes" option that let you search for things like happy / sad etc tweets
Geotagged tweets may be useful in determining a users location if they only tweet things like "theres an earthquake happening here"

Owen has android app experience, but it was a long time ago


App relies on the news analyser
If we do the specificaton well we could do both in parallel
Should the app poll the server or should we push updates to it
Ticker type design would be simpler
Alerting as soon as something happens would be better, maybe allow custom alerts to be set up?


UI Design
We should get lots of people to test our UI


Map Reduce vs Multithreaded
Map reduce is complex
Could have one main server that passes jobs to the slaves
Owen and Alex have used threads before
- It can be quite tricky
Java has a nice multithreading api


Owen and Alex prefer to do the backend stuff
Will do any though if we have to
Theres an android emulator we can use

Alex, Owen and Aaron are all happy to go the conference call on Thursday


News Sources
Twitter
BBC

Create a general RSS parser (maybe one already exists)

Version Control
Probably, git and github
